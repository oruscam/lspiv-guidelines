# LSPIV User Guide

## 📌 Introduction
This repository contains the **Introductory Practical Guide to Flow Measurement Using Images**, designed to provide best practices and recommendations for new users interested in measuring surface velocity and water flow using **Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV)**.

This guide was developed as part of the project **"RIVeR-LAC: Innovation in Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry for Water Resource Management"**. The project was selected through the **WMO HydroHub Innovation Call for Latin America and the Caribbean**, organized by the **World Meteorological Organization (WMO)** and funded by the **Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)**.

## 🚀 Key Features

This guide is designed in **simple language**, bridging the gap between users with **little or no experience** and highly technical documentation. It is **richly illustrated with figures and diagrams**, making complex concepts easier to understand.

🔍 **A Practical Approach: From Fieldwork to Data Processing**  
- 🎥 **Fieldwork: Capturing the Flow**  
  - Guidance on selecting the **best recording method** and setting up field equipment.  
  - Key recommendations for **video acquisition** to ensure reliable results.  
  - **Field verification and quality control** to minimize errors and improve measurement accuracy.

- 🖥 **Processing Steps: From Video to Flow Data**  
  - Overview of **software options** and essential data validation steps.  
  - General workflow for **video processing, image transformation, and velocity estimation**.  
  - Methods for **flow calculation** based on LSPIV analysis.  

📚 **Want to Go Deeper?**  
- This guide includes **annexes** where advanced users can explore **technical details**.  

🌎 **Available in Multiple Languages**  

## 📖 How to Access the Guide
The **LSPIV User Guide** is available in two languages:
