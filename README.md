# LSPIV User Guide

## 📌 Introduction
This repository contains the **Introductory Practical Guide to Flow Measurement Using Images**, designed to provide best practices and recommendations for new users interested in measuring surface velocity and water flow using **Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV)**.

This guide was hosteded and led by [ORUS](https://x.com/Orus_cam) as part of the project **"RIVeR-LAC: Innovation in Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry for Water Resource Management"**. The project was selected through the **WMO HydroHub Innovation Call for Latin America and the Caribbean**, organized by the **World Meteorological Organization (WMO)** and funded by the **Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)**.

## 📥 Download PDF Guidelines
For your convenience, you can download the complete guidelines in PDF format:
